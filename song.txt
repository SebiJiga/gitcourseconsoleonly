Uh, back in the day, huh-huh (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
We used to play, huh-huh
Now we so older
My bitches are older (Swamp Izzo)
Drivin' the cold blow (Ha, ha, ha)
My bitches are pop, ooh
My vibes are top floors
I leave her, she slam doors
Closed casket, woah-woah
Big bank, jumbo
Look how fast, look at my dash, fuck up the turbo (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
AP glass, they send me a bag and I went to Soho
Ice on my wrist, I got a rich ho
She blowin' minds, this ho a lil' freak ho
I told a ho, "Slow it up 'cause you got a free throw"

I'm tryna see where you went at (Ha)
I'm tryna see if you winnin' (Ha)
How you tryna fuck up the money (Ha, ha)
And still ask a nigga for pennies?
I cook on you hoes like Beni'
Every day, I'm off limits (Yes, sir)
Double-0, YV business
Drank all in my kidneys (Swamp)
I'm sorry that I caught you, bitch, you already know I go looking for shit (Swamp)
I'm richer than all my opps (Ha)
That's a big plot twist (Ha)
I'm prayin' for all of my opps while I'm hawking for my next bitch (Ha, ha)
Oh, you prayin' for them motherfuckers now, Carti?
Yeah, they got a death wish
Yeah, he gotta go, bitch (Ah)
And I know he know this (Ah)
They said they seen him run out the club, bitch, and I was late to notice (Ah)
That Double-0-5 sittin' on my back, bitch, it ain't hard to notice
If I seen that pussy alive, eat him alive, I'm focused
Alive, alive, alive, alive
She want the check before the neck, respect (Ah)
She want the check before the neck, respect (Ah)
