Uh, back in the day, huh-huh (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
We used to play, huh-huh
Now we so older
My bitches are older (Swamp Izzo)
Drivin' the cold blow (Ha, ha, ha)
My bitches are pop, ooh
My vibes are top floors
I leave her, she slam doors
Closed casket, woah-woah
Big bank, jumbo
Look how fast, look at my dash, fuck up the turbo (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
AP glass, they send me a bag and I went to Soho
Ice on my wrist, I got a rich ho
She blowin' minds, this ho a lil' freak ho
I told a ho, "Slow it up 'cause you got a free throw"
